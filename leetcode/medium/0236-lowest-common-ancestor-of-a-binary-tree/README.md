# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow  **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
- -109 <= Node.val <= 109
- All Node.val are unique.
- p != q
- p and q will exist in the tree.

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(
        self, root: "TreeNode", p: "TreeNode", q: "TreeNode"
    ) -> "TreeNode":

        if not root:
            return None

        if root == p:
            return p

        if root == q:
            return q

        left_n = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right_n = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        if left_n is not None and right_n is not None:
            return root
        elif left_n is not None and right_n is None:
            return left_n
        else:
            return right_n

```
